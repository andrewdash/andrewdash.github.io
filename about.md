Hello! I'm Andrew Le.

I'm currently working in business operations at Flexport, which means I ideate, write, and execute on business plans that speed up work for business teams (and myself). Previously I worked in venture capital at Impact Venture Capital, contributing with deal sourcing and research. Before that I interned in Product Strategy at Zendesk.

__Some projects I've worked on.__
