[Here is an analysis of Airbnb host data](/assets/files/airbnb v1.2.pdf) and how I think Airbnb hosts could be better engaged.

<br>

Airbnb is one of the most familiar tech names today. It's got a $30B company valuation (Expedia and TripAdvisor are worth $19B and $8B, respectively) with listings in 65,000 cities and 2M guests at any given night. It's one of the most valuable private companies today and is continuing to expand its offerings across all things related to travel.

Airbnb is great because its often the most economical lodging choice. If its listings aren't around, then we resort to renting motels, hotels, or whatever accommodations are in the place we're looking to travel to. And that's what people did before Airbnb! It took the company years of gathering listings of homes and hosts to create the platform it has today.

Since I've used Airbnb a fair amount, I'm guessing the typical rental reservation process for a guest looks like this:
1. search up location I want to travel to
2. identify listings within my price range
3. evaluate listings based on:

- geographic location (is it central to things I want to visit)
- professionalism (nice pictures, well-developed listing information)
- convenience (fewer barriers to rental, like a eased cancellation policy, reasonable cleaning fee, being instantly bookable)

*_Convenience_* is really important. I quickly turn away from listings have hosts who are seemingly difficult or deceptive. I'll avoid places that have really high cleaning fees (a common tactic to offset a rental prices to make it seem more inexpensive in the front page). I'll avoid places with really strict cancellation policies as not to tie me down to a location when another (better) one might pop up. It may not be done intentionally, but for some listings, there appears to be a break in the barrier of trust between guest and host.

With Airbnb's current capabilities, there is no way for hosts to know how "_convenience_" factors like cleaning fee, being instantly bookable, cancellation policy, or others, are perceived by guests. Hosts now kind of have to choose settings at will and hope for the best. Airbnb did release Smart Pricing to ease the headache of figuring out what precise rental prices should be, taking into consideration seasonality, busy weekends, etc. But why don't other features have this same recommending capability?

I looked at Airbnb host data, provided by insideairbnb.com, and found some trends in the hosts that could be useful for making recommendations.
