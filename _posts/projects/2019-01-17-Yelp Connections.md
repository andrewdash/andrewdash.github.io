[In this deck, I outline my recommendations](/assets/files/yelp v1.2 presented.pdf) for what Yelp could do to add value to Yelp Connections in order to increase its user stickiness. Below is a summary of how I came about this project and why I found it interesting.

<br>
<br>

I, like most people my age that I know, have been using Yelp for a long time. It's the go-to-resource for finding bars and restaurants when travelling around to places we don't know about. Or within a familiar area, it's also useful for exploring new restaurants. But aside from finding a spot to grab food or drinks, I can't recall distinct instances where Yelp's marketing introduced a new product, made suggestions for how to use new features, or if there was really anything new with Yelp at all. So I decided to dive a little deeper.

After looking around the Yelp app, I learned **Yelp looks to be a comprehensive service that connects people to restaurants AND services** (like plumbing, dry-cleaners). It wants to let people make reservations through the app, order delivery, find deals, and more. There are tons of features Well beyond just the "restaurant app" we were so familiar with.

One Yelp offering, Yelp Connections, is particularly interesting. It lets you view groupings of restaurants created by Yelp users that they would suggest. You can search by city to see what people are recommending in different spots. I was completely unaware that Yelp Connections was a feature, so I looked into it more.

**Yelp Connections must be important, but why have I never heard of it?** Yelp Connections is 1 of 5 icons always present on the screen (search, delivery, me, collections, more), taking up valuable UI real-estate that could be used for something else. At first glance, bunch of the users who created a collection were Yelp Elite (expected, since these are the power users), but with a feature so central to the Yelp app, shouldn't it be more accessible to the every-day person?

<br>

I first did a Google search of Yelp Collections. Yelp Collections is a feature introduced around May 2018 as the company's move towards introducing ML/AI into its product. Product Manager Jay Garg wrote [in a blog](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/yelp-collections-announced/) post that Yelp Connections recommends, "based on your activity on Yelp and [by] amplifying top recommendations from across the Yelp Community." The 'based on your activity on Yelp' is a crucial point. ML algorithms typically work like this: the more data that is available, the more confident the recommendation could be. Facebook/Instagram/Snap users browse their feeds for hours at a time, generating tons of data to make fair recommendations. But What's the chance an AVERAGE person browses the Yelp app enough to make a good recommendation? In my perspective, the chances aren't great.

So the question begs: What can be done to the Yelp Collections feature to make it more useful to users, which makes the app more interesting/sticky, which makes it more useful to advertisers?
