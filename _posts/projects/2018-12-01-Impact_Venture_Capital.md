Impact Venture Capital is a $100M venture fund started by Dixon Doll (founder of DCM Ventures, $3B+ AUM), and Eric Ball and Jack Crawford of Oracle. As a Venture Fellow there, I got to get a close look into different parts of the business while also having the flexibility to get into interesting projects. Like any other intro level venture role, I was mostly focused on the earliest parts of company outreach/due diligence. I spent a fair portion of my time doing operational work, which was initially consuming but became more optimized as I kept thinking of new ways to reduce the mental power it would take to complete those assignments. The more mental power I could strip off from repeated assignments, the more I could accomplish while having the time/energy to think about what interesting things I could contribute to Impact.

With this mindset and a big focus of my time on top-of-the-funnel deal flow, I wanted to think about ways to streamline the information I was passing onto my bosses. I was fortunate enough to be able to present my information directly to the Principal and General Partner (because of the lean team there), so that was extra incentive to make sure I could put in place standardized processes. Although I cannot publicly share the exact deal flow pipeline, after a lot of independent research, readings, conversations with decision holders at Impact, and conversations with acquaintances I had made within venture, here is a general approach of what I implemented internally at ImpactVC and the questions I asked myself that guided each step.






As a plus, I had a great experience getting front-time with interesting high-net-worth families and people at the helm of billions of dollars in assets (where else would you get to do that?).
