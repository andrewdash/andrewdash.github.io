[In this deck, I outline my recommendations](/assets/files/yelp_presented.pdf) for what Yelp could do to add value to Yelp Connections in order to increase its user stickiness. Below is a summary of how I came about this project and why I found it interesting.

<br>

I, like most people my age that I know, have been using Yelp for a long time. It's the go-to-resource for finding bars and restaurants when travelling around to places we don't know about. Or within a familiar area, it's also useful for exploring new restaurants. But aside from finding a spot to grab food or drinks, I can't recall distinct instances where Yelp's marketing introduced a new product/feature that made it into main stream use. I figured taking a closer look at Yelp could be interesting.

After digging around the Yelp app, I learned **Yelp looks to be a comprehensive service that connects people to restaurants AND services** (like plumbing, dry-cleaners). It wants to let people make reservations through the app, order delivery, find deals, and more. There are tons of features well beyond just the "restaurant app" we were so familiar with.

One Yelp offering, Yelp Connections, is particularly interesting. It lets you view groupings of restaurants created by Yelp users that they would suggest. You can search by city to see what people are recommending in different spots. I was completely unaware that Yelp Connections was a feature, so I looked into it more.

**Yelp Connections must be important, but why does it seem like a lot of people haven't heard of it?** Yelp Connections is 1 of 5 icons always present on the screen (the icons are: search, delivery, me, collections, more), taking up valuable UI real-estate that could be used for something else. At a first glance, about half of the users I saw that created a collection were Yelp Elite (expected, since these are the power users), but with a feature so central to the Yelp app, shouldn't it be more accessible and used by the every-day person?

> How can Yelp Collections be better?

I first did a Google search of Yelp Collections to get some background information. Yelp Collections was introduced in May 2018 as the company's move towards introducing ML/AI into its product. Product Manager Jay Garg wrote [in a blog](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/yelp-collections-announced/) post that Yelp Connections recommends, "based on your activity on Yelp and [by] amplifying top recommendations from across the Yelp Community."

The 'based on your activity on Yelp' is a crucial point. ML algorithms roughly work like this: the more data that is available, the more confident the recommendation could be. Facebook/Instagram/Snap users browse their feeds for hours at a time, generating tons of data that their AI-recommending systems can make confident predictions on. But what's the chance an AVERAGE person browses the Yelp app long enough (and often enough) to make a solid recommendation? In my perspective, the chances aren't great.

**So the question begs:** How can Yelp Connections be better? What can be done to the Yelp Collections feature to make it more useful to users, which makes the app more interesting/sticky, which makes it more useful to advertisers, thus being a better product for everyone?
