__*Summary*__
: I created an end-to-end methodology for documenting how ImpactVC analyzes startups, called the "deal flow pipeline." I centralized different stages of analysis into one platform, letting us review and improve our performance over time. By implementing clear checkpoints that startups would need to reach before we moved onto the next stage of analysis, we were able to keep better track of the most interesting companies to invest in. Creating the deal flow pipeline made looking at startups 2x as fast, and automating parts of the process made it easy for me to assign priorities across the venture fellow team.

**-----** <br>

__*Introduction*__
: Impact Venture Capital is a $100M venture fund started by Dixon Doll (founder of DCM Ventures, $3B+ AUM), and Eric Ball and Jack Crawford of Oracle. As a Venture Fellow there, I got to get a close look into different parts of the business while also having the flexibility to get into interesting projects. Was really fortunate to have gotten face time with entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs, and people at the helm of billions of dollars in assets-- what other industry could a 20-something-year-old possibly get this kind of exposure?

<br>
__*Motivation*__
: Similar to other analyst venture roles, I was mostly focused on screening startups and the earliest parts of company outreach/due diligence. With such a lean team at Impact (I reported directly to the Principal and one General Partner) and a bulk of my time being the first screen to startups, our process initially was to take a (somewhat) deep dive into _every_ startup that came my way. In the flow of things, that meant 1 hour-ish of market research, comprehensive thoughts on the pitch deck, and a write-up to tie it all together. Spending 2+ hours on the first look of a start up was too time-consuming, so I needed a way to focus my time only on the most interesting companies.

<br>
: Although I cannot publicly share the exact deal flow pipeline, after a lot of independent research, readings, conversations with decision holders at Impact, and conversations with acquaintances I had made within venture, here is a general approach of what I implemented internally at ImpactVC, as well as the questions I asked myself that guided each step.
<br>
<br>

__*Process*__
: **1. Companies have sales pipelines-- venture firms have deal flow pipelines**
I thought about how companies had sales pipelines, where customer leads are often ranked from highest to lowest priority. Venture firms do the same thing, except instead of trying to sell a customer a product, we're looking to "sell" our expertise, network, and investment to the next wave of innovative leaders. We asked, "What makes this startup a high priority?", and I formulized the process around it.

**2. The deal flow pipeline balances two dimensions: KNOWLEDGE and TIME.**
Venture firms wish they could know everything about a start up, but the reality is there isn't enough time nor resources to do so. For analyzing startups, at least before we start having deep conversations with the company, prioritizing what to analyze is about figuring out what's going to give us the most knowledge in the least amount of time.

__*Result*__
: Creating different stages in how we analyzed startups took the mental work from "Here's this startup-- what do we need to look at?" to "Here's this startup-- why is it uniquely competitive?" Conducting analysis was at minimum 2x faster, scalable (stages of analysis were clearly defined), easy to understand (information was centralized in one place), and communicable to senior management (I automated the process of creating reports). Ultimately, it made my job a little easier and more productive, which helps let me focus on the most important things.

__*Introduction*__
Impact Venture Capital is a $100M venture fund started by Dixon Doll (founder of DCM Ventures, $3B+ AUM), and Eric Ball and Jack Crawford of Oracle. As a Venture Fellow there, I got to get a close look into different parts of the business while also having the flexibility to get into interesting projects. Was really fortunate to have gotten face time with entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs, and people at the helm of billions of dollars in assets-- what other industry could a 20-something-year-old possibly get this kind of exposure?

Similar to other analyst venture roles, I was mostly focused on screening startups and the earliest parts of company outreach/due diligence. I spent a fair portion of my time doing operational work, which was initially consuming but became more optimized as I kept thinking of new ways to compartmentalize the time it took to complete those assignments. The more mental power I could strip off from frequent (but incredibly necessary) operations, the more I could accomplish while having the time/energy to think about what interesting things I could contribute to Impact.

With this mindset and a big focus of my time on top-of-the-funnel deal flow, I wanted to think about ways to streamline the information I was passing onto my bosses. I was fortunate enough to be able to present my information directly to the Principal and General Partner (because of the lean team there), so that was extra incentive to make sure I could put in place standardized processes. Although I cannot publicly share the exact deal flow pipeline, after a lot of independent research, readings, conversations with decision holders at Impact, and conversations with acquaintances I had made within venture, here is a general approach of what I implemented internally at ImpactVC, as well as the questions I asked myself that guided each step.

**1. Companies have sales pipelines-- venture firms have deal flow pipelines**
: Sales teams can't treat every lead as if it would convert into the most valuable customer. Instead, some leads have certain characteristics that are signals for a high-value customer. Venture firms work the same way, except the "leads" are startups. Eventually, the relationship of a venture firm towards a startup goes from "we only know a little bit about you, tell us about yourself" to "we're putting dollars into your company." Every step in between those, which includes a lot of research, conversations with the startup, references with independent professionals, and more, are pieces of the deal flow pipeline. This leads us to the next point...
<br> <br>

**2. The deal flow pipeline balances two dimensions: KNOWLEDGE and TIME.**
: The more time we spent researching a single start up, the more knowledge we would obtain about it. There are so many startups (both good and bad) out there to review, at least for a first glance, that we can't spend all day looking at just one start up. If we're going to look deeply into a company, we should be fairly confident before that point that the startup has good potential for us to make an investment into it. We needed to create different checkpoints along the research process to decide: 1. let's look into it more, or 2. for X, Y, and Z reasons, this startup doesn't fit our investment criteria.
<br> <br>

**3. What research tasks give us the most bang for our time?**
: Venture firms, depending on their size, review tens of companies a day. It doesn't sound like much, but if an analyst/associate is looking at 10 companies per day at 30 minutes each, that's 20 hrs/week on just pure examination. Counting in the time it takes to write up materials, notes, polish it, and review it (so you don't embarrass yourself sending it up the chain), this could easily be pushed to 30-40 hours a week.

We asked ourselves: what would be the most time efficient method to learn the most about a startup? You can think of this as the 80/20 rule-- we wanted to learn 80% of a company in 20% of the time, so that on the next stages of examining, we could narrow the pool further and further.
<br> <br>

**4. How can we standardize and automate processes?**
: Centralizing the information in one spot with consistent formatting lets us view our thought process and performance over time so that we could evaluate it and find ways to further optimize. I then created ways to automate information retrieval to help save more time and eliminate any chance of human error.  

<br> <br>

As a plus, I had a great experience getting front-time with interesting high-net-worth families and people at the helm of billions of dollars in assets (where else would you get to do that?).
