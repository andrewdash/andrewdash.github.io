I took a stab at machine learning in python as it applies to words and text data.

Machine Learning on Text Data[(/assets/files/***********)]

The idea is that, let's say we're given a bunch of observations (each row on an Excel sheet) that have some amount of sentences and text attached to it (column B of the Excel sheet), whom are split into 7 different groups (column C of the Excel sheet that has values ranging from 1-7). Now if we're handed some sentences and we're asked, "Which group 1-7 do these sentences represent?", how would we go about solving this? This is where machine learning comes in.

Thinking about the data in terms of an Excel sheet is a good mental model, but Python is where this analysis is going to happen (I don't think Excel can do this).

I looked at scientific paper data, gathering a list of scientific paper abstracts from the [Springer website](https://dev.springernature.com/), a popular publisher for scientific journals/articles.

##Why did I choose this data set?
1. Getting an amazing accuracy rate would be *very* challenging


Here is the process

For reference, here is the long-form analysis. This just goes into further description on how I came about creating the hypothesis, things that influenced that thought process, and other miscellaneous information.
