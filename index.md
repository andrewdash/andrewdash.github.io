My name is Andrew Le, and I am a recent UC Davis graduate (December 2018).

As a student, I worked in venture capital at Impact Venture Capital, where I created the investment platform that they use today for due diligence. I'm proud that my involvement and research led to an active investment and the largest-ever startup event in Sacramento history (1000+ people). Previously also interned in Product Strategy at Zendesk.
